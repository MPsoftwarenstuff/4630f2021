This is my Dice Roll project that I wrote with the help of Android Studio tutorials. I was forced to upload a ZIP folder of all my files because for some reason Git lost all of it's files and preferences on my computer and I have not been able to get it up and running yet. The app can roll a Die and display multiple different images. There is a "Meet the Dev" button that is supposed to open a new activity, but unfortunately at this time I am not able to get the button to properly switch between activities. The Textviews are all using string resources and the imageView is working. The program compiles and runs. The Roll button generates a true random number and gives a toast to indicate whether the user has rolled the lucky number (which is chosen at startup).
