Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.

-We did not have class to discuss this yet. Unfortunately, most of the app ideas from my survey were very non-original



Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.

-A lot of developers would say that microtransactions and digital gambling are excellent ways to support an app while remaining free to play. If you don't want to charge ANY money, you can crowdfund the creation of new features and DLC for your app



Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.

-I have found that the UI in apple devices is typically fairly streamlined. It is not difficult to find most settings and most information is not hidden behind more than 2 or 3 menu options.



Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.

-I have definitely had more time to think about what I want. I have a general idea of what technologies i'd like to implement in my app but not sure how to style/cater it.
I think making an app that functions as a database would be ideal and then I could implement a lot of options for manipulating that data and adding to it.
