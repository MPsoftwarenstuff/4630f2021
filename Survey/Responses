| Person        | Problem       | App found?    | Pros          | Cons          | Improvements  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|
| Friend  | Synchronize music across multiple devices  | Spotify has a "group session" feature that allows multiple people to *choose* music, but nothing that synchronizes multiple audio sources  | No pros since it doesn't exist  | No cons since it doesn't exist  | Spotify could very easily create additional features for their group sessions such as syncing devices that are both playing |
|
| Friend  | SiS is poorly designed and needs an app that can make navigation more straightforward       | There is an app for Blackboard, but it is pretty bad too. SiS does not have a mobile app because it is a web app by design    | Being a web app means SiS is more compatible with different devices, so technically a web app could just exist within a mobile app shell with little effort          | Web apps are notoriously finicky and SiS is too difficult to navigate.          |  A good mobile reimagining of SiS would need to build its menu system from the ground up  |

| Anonymous Submission        | App to highlight local businesses, specifically businesses that sell - or specialize - in hard to find amenities | An app like this does not exist    | An app like this would be a huge help to niche customers        | An app like this would require many people to be updating their inventories and managing their digital storefront on a regular basis and would likely have issues catering to each business on an individual, marketable level          | This would probably be better as a website that a single person could maintain, and each business could have free reign over their page on the website  |
|
| Family        | App to manage fridge contents      | Yes, many apps such as Fridge Pal and Fresh Box offer this functionality    | The app Fridge Pal is easy to use and offers straightforward functionality         | Requires manual data entry which is a turn-off for consumers and ultimately an achilles' heel.   | Ideally, scan a receipt instead of individual items and instantly pull all items from receipts  |
